# Proxy-Server-Herd
Wikipedia and its related sites are based on the Wikimedia Architecture, which uses a LAMP platform based on GNU/Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP, using multiple, redundant web servers be- hind a load-balancing virtual router for reliability and perfor- mance. This project aims to summarise the implementation of a server herd that allows for scaling by having servers communicate with each other. Load-balancing is acheived by making each server respond to local API requests from clients. Servers do not have to communicate with the entire network to share information to the entire network; they only need to know about their neighbors. This project also aims to display the pros and cons of using the asyncio Python module and how it compares with other options.
